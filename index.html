Get to know me!
</p>
<p>
Hello! My name is Garner Gay! I am a sophomore, almost a junior at UGA. I am involved with Delta Delta Delta Sorority, Relay for Life, and the Wesley Foundation. Although I never want to graduate, I am excited to be turning 20 in less than a month. Growing up in Dublin, Georgia, it is only fitting my favorite color is green. If I had to listen to any music for the rest of my life, it would be NEEDTOBREATHE. If you were to look at my bank statemetns, you would find that I eat Chick-fil-bae way too much. In case you missed any of that, I made a table for you!

<p>My love for NEEDTOBREATHE has only grown with the release of their newest album HARDLOVE this past summer. I listened to it all summer when I worked at camp, and I went to their concert this past August. I love them because their lyrics are uplifting, their sound is contantly evolving, and mainly becuase their music is osmething that my friends and I listen to and bond over.</p>

<p>I also have a passion for UGA football. Though each loss this past season was more painful than the last, I still attended every game through the rain, wind, and blistering sun. Going to football games and keeping up with stats of players is one of my favorite ways to spend a Saturday in Athens. I am so excited to have G-Day this weekend to get to preview this next season begin to get excited for next season! <em>Go Dawgs!</em></p>
